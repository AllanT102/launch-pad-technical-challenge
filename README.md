###Problem (Frontend Web)

You and your friends are developing a new start-up called DRUBER, a drone-based ride share application that carries you to your destination. The original specification was to develop a web page that works in 1920x1080 however your company has realized that it is missing an entire market of smartphone users. Describe how you can modify your code to work in smartphone resolutions e.g. 750x1334 (iPhone 8). Please give specific examples where possible, but do not implement an entire DRUBER clone!

BEFORE:

<img src="./src/images/before1.png"/>

This looks fine doesn't it?     

<img src="./src/images/before2.png" style="width: 200px height: 200px">
<img src="./src/images/before3.png" style="width: 200px height: 200px"/>
The problem with the implementation before, was that it was not responsive. Images and text would be squished if the window was resized, which is TERRIBLE.
